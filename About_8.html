                Are you interested in getting to know me? I'm 8ball. My mother and father adopted me from the streets of Montr√©al when I was about 1 year old. I'm 4 years old now, and my made-up birthday is October 20th, just in time for Halloween. My mom always puts costumes on me which is not my favorite but she says it makes me look cute. I am all black but have 2 small patches of white on my chest and stomach. Mom says I'm half Maine coon cat because I'm really big. Sometimes I make a really funny face that you can see on my Instagram. My favorite pastime is playing in reusable grocery bags and of course sleeping. My humans think it's funny when I have the zoomies after going to the bathroom. I love looking out the window at the seagulls. I could definitely catch one if there wasn't glass in between us. Like most cats, I'm addicted to treats but I am not allowed too many because they will make me "chunky", says my parents but I disagree. I don't hate many things but the things I do hate include the vacuum, bubble baths, and tummy rubs. If you have any questions contact my parents and they will answer all your questions.
